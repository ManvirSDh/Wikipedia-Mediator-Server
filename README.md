# Wikipedia-Mediator-Server

This is a class project involving interacting with Wikipedia and performing many operations on the response.

This includes a server that takes requests (from multiple clients, and can manage multiple requests at the same time) from users, feeds that input to a Wikipedia API and then returns the relavant reponse, after running analysis on the return.

It also caches the responses for quicker reponse time and fewer necessary network requests. This is implemented from scratch.

This project showcases knowledge of:
  * Multithreading
  * Shared memory management
  * JSON parsing
  * Caching techiques
  * Server / Client network interaction
